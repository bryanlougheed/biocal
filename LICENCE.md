This particular licence includes a "NoDerivates" clause, which means that you cannot officially republish a modified form of the scripts. However, just get in contact me if you are planning on doing so, so that I can grant permission. Unfortunately I had to choose this slightly more restrictive open-source licence due to recent citation-farming trends in science.
