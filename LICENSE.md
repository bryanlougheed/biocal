This particular license is "NoDerivates", which means that you cannot officially republish a modified form of the scripts. However, just get in contact me if you are planning on doing so, so that I can grant permission. Unfortunately I had to choose this slightly more restrictive open-source license due to the latest citation-farming trend in science where people re-publish other people's scripts under a new name without first contacting the author.
